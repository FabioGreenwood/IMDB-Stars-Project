# IMDB-Stars-Project

Masters degree project for programming module.

Limited documentation on the project will be uploaded at a later date


# Project Objectives

This project aims to answer the following business questions:

### Primary BQs:
1. Are there actors with “star power” who herald success for their films?
2. Are there dud actors who herald failure for their films? (i.e. the data suggests that their presence alone will negatively effect a film with an otherwise stellar cast)
3. What is the effect of dud actors on films with “star power”?

And may attempt (time willing) to answer the following:


### Secondary BQs:
4. How is this effected by genre?
5. Can we create a scoring predictor?


# File Stucture
 
 1. programming_analysis_project_colab_original
  Original doodle created on google colab
  
 2. programming_analysis_project_data_prep.py
  Script for creating "metadata" tables from IMDB's relational databases on every film they track.
  IMDB's data needed to be agrigated and filtered due to its size

3. programming_analysis_project_analysis_file.py
  Script to analyse the "metadata" tables produced by "programming_analysis_project_data_prep.py"



# Note on data bias

Admittedly there will be data bias in this project, this project was selected regardless due to the fact:
 - this module is marked according to programming ability
 - for the opportunity for myself to work and transform imperfect data
 - my personal interest in what I could glean from this data
 - personal interest seeing if I could (*partially*) address *some* of the data bias
 - personally challenge myself on controlling scope on an open-ended project
